## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "My site isn't showing up"
- Wait 2-3 minutes after enabling Pages
- Ensure repository is **Public** (not Private)
- Check Settings → Pages shows green checkmark

### "My changes aren't appearing"
- Wait ~1 minute for GitHub to rebuild your site
- Hard refresh: `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)
- Check you clicked "Commit changes" after editing

### "Images aren't loading"
- File names are case-sensitive: `Photo.png` ≠ `photo.png`
- Check file path matches exactly
- Use forward slashes: `/` not backslashes `\`

### "I see someone else's information"
- You're viewing the **template** - create your own copy with "Use this template"
- Make sure you're editing **your** repository, not the template
